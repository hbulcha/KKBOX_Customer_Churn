    "KKBox is a music streaming service based in Taiwan, which offers customers access to songs based on a payment plan. Customer retention is key to business stability, particularly when that business is based off of subscriptions. Yet prior to implementing any strategies to improve retention, the business needs an accurate method to discern those subscribers most likely to churn. KKBox defines a customer as having \"churned\" if no new transactions are initiated within a month of the user's subscription expiring.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement**: Provide a method to identify customers most likely to churn. \n",
    "\n",
    "We approach this as a supervised learning problem where the requirement is to build a classifier which maps the available attributes of a customer to a label for whether the customer has churned or not. The relevant metrics include any attributes which are directly or indirectly related to a customer's behavior. "

    "All of the features used in our classifiers are taken directly or otherwise derived from the four files provided by KKBox on members, user logs, transactions and train data. Members consists of personal information about each subscriber, presented as a single row per subscriber with a unique identifier. Similarly, the train file provides an indicator for whether each subscriber churned during February 2017. Transactions and user logs cover payment and streaming information respectively during the time period January 2015 - February 2017. The unit of granularity for transactions is a payment or cancellation, whereas a single row in user_logs corresponds to an instance where the user logged in and streamed music.  "

    "\n",
    "Since Jupyter notebooks cannot handle this amount of data, we restrict the dataset to a random sample of 20,000 users and all their related information in each of the files. We then randomly split this into a train/test set for analysis. In doing so, we have also adjusted the requirement to predicting churn information within the same time period. The original requirement was training the model on one time period with feature data through February 2017, and churn labels in March 2017. The prediction would be based on a different time period with features through March 2017, and churn labels to be predicted in April 2017. As a result of the different time periods, the KKBox data allows for the same user to exist in both the train and test sets. \n",

    "However, our analysis will stick to the original time period (February 2017) for both consuming training data and predicting test data for a random sample of 20,000 users. In this way, we ensure that the users in the train set are different from those of the test set. We first generate a list of these users from the train file and use it to filter the other files."

The list price for 30 days plans is usually \\$149, so we see \\$149 listed as the 50th and 75th percentiles of both `plan_list_price` and `actual_amount_paid`. Plans generally get more expensive as they get longer, and the most expensive plan (\\$2,000) was for 400 days. In general, the amount people actually paid for their streaming plans is the same as the list price. However, we were surprised to see the mean payment is actually slightly larger than the mean list price, when we expected the reverse due to discounts and sales."

    "The accuracy of the best performing model as reported by the grid search is only marginally better than our baseline of accuracy where we predict all individuals as churning. However, when we examine the classification report, we find that the model will fail to identify 69% of customers who are going to churn (False Negatives), and will wrongly identify 1% of renewing customers as churning (False Positives). Despite the false positives, this model still offers some value to KKBox compared to the baseline of assuming that all customers will not churn, because it _does_ manage to identify 31% of churning customers, giving KKBox a chance to take action to retain those customers."

    "Most noticeably in the graph below, the No PCA dataset consistently reports higher accuracy, peaking at 0.938 at `alpha=0`. None of the three datasets perform better than the baseline of 0.938. Reducing dimensionality does not improve the Naive Bayes model for our dataset. A plausible explanation for why Bernoulli Naive Bayes performs worse than K Nearest Neighbors is that many of the features in this data set are not independent of one another. For example, the lifetime of a customer is correlated to the count of transactions. "

    "\n",
    "After constructing three different supervised learning models on three different datasets, the highest accuracy we were able to achieve on the dev set was 0.973. While this may seem a marginal improvement over a model that predicts everybody will renew, we argue that KKBox is better off identifying members who may churn using the logistic regression model with no PCA, and intervening to retain those members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume KKBox decides to give a \\$10 bonus to every member that we predict will churn. In the test set with 4,000 members, our model predicts 213 members will churn. Of these, 164 will actually churn and 49 will not. Supposing that the \\$10 bonus strategy is effective 50% of the time, KKBox will retain 82 customers for at least one additional month. The subscription payments from these customers will bring in \\$149 $\\times$ 82, which more than offsets the cost of giving the bonus to the 82 converts and the 49 people who would have renewed anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this model is likely to bring value, we recommend an extension from the 20,000 members to the full dataset as the logical next step."
